Now, let's discuss a closely related topic - reproductive health. What do we understand by this term? The term simply refers to healthy reproductive organs with normal functions.However, it has a broader perspective and includes the emotional and social aspects of reproduction also.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reproductive health means a total well-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e.，physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Therefore, a society with people having physically and functionally normal reproductive organs and normal emotional and behavioural interactions among them in all sex-related aspects might be called reproductively healthy.Why is it significant to maintain reproductive health and what are the methods taken up to achieve it? Let us examine them. \n\n3.1 REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH - PROBLEMS AND STRATEGIES \n\nIndia was amongst the first countries in the world to initiate action plans and programmes at a national level to attain total reproductive health as a social goal. These programmes called ‘family planning' were initiated in 1951 and were periodically assessed over the past decades. Improved programmes covering wider reproduction-related areas are currently in operation under the popular name ‘Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) programmes'. Creating awareness among people about various reproduction related aspects and providing facilities and support for building up a reproductively healthy society are the major tasks under these programmes. \n\nWith the help of audio-visual and the print-media governmental and non-governmental agencies have taken various steps to create awareness among the people about reproduction-related aspects.Parents,other close relatives,teachers and friends,also have a major role in the dissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education in schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to the young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and having misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information about reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS, etc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to lead a reproductively healthy life. Educating people,especially fertile couples and those in marriageable age group,about available birth control options, care of pregnant mothers, post-natal care of the mother and child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male and the female child, etc., would address the importance of bringing up socially conscious healthy families of desired size. Awareness of problems due to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and sex-related crimes, etc., need to be created to enable people to think and take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a socially responsible and healthy society. \n\nSuccessful implementation of various action plans to attain reproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional expertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical assistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like pregnancy, delivery, STDs,abortions, contraception, menstrual problems, infertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies from time to time are also required to provide more efficient care and assistance to people. Statutory ban on amniocentesis for sex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides, massive child immunisation,etc.，are some programmes that merit mention in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic fluid of the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved substances.This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain genetic disorders such as,down syndrome,haemoplilia，sickle-cell anemia, etc., determine the survivability of the foetus. \n\nResearch on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and supported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out new methods and/or to improve upon the existing ones. Do you know that ‘Saheli'-a new oral contraceptive for the females-was developed by scientists at Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India? Better awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically assisted deliveries and better post-natal care leading to decreased maternal and infant mortality rates, increased number of couples with small families, better detection and cure of STDs and overallincreased medical facilities for all sex-related problems, etc.all indicate improved reproductive health of the society. \n\n3.2 POPULATION STABILISATION AND BIRTH CONTROL \n\nIn the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly improved the quality of life of the people. However, increased health facilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on the growth of population. The world population which was around 2 billion (200O million) in 190O rocketed to about 6 billion by 2000 and 7.2 billion in 2O11.A similar trend was observed in India too.Our population which was approximately 35O million at the time of our independence reached close to the billion mark by 2ooO and crossed 1.2 billion in May 2O11. A rapid decline in death rate, maternal mortality rate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) as wel as an increase in number of people in reproducible age are probable reasons for this. Through our Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programme, though we could bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal. According to the 2O11 census report, the population growth rate was less than 2 per cent, i.., 20/10oo/year, a rate at which our population could increase rapidly. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an absolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and clothing, in spite of significant progress made in those areas. Therefore, the government was forced to take up serious measures to check this population growth rate. \n\nThe most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller families by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen advertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy couple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do (we two, our two). Many couples, mostly the young,urban, working ones have even adopted an ‘one child norm'. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the female to 18 years and that of males to 21 years,and incentives given to couples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle this problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive methods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies. \n\nAn ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly，easily available, effective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no way interfere with the sexual drive,desire and/or the sexual act of the user. A wide range of contraceptive methods are presently available which could be broadly grouped into the following categories,namely Natural/Traditional,Barrier, IUDs,Oral contraceptives, Injectables, Implants and Surgical methods. \n\nNatural methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum and sperms meeting. Periodic abstinence is one such method in which the couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 1O to 17 of the menstrual cycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are very high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by abstaining from coitus during this period, conception could be prevented. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is another method in which the male partner withdraws his penis from the vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid insemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation and therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of intense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long as the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of conception are almost nil. However, this method has been reported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six months following parturition.As no medicines or devices are used in these methods, side effects are almost nil. Chances of failure, though, of this method are also high. \n\nIn barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented from physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such methods are available for both males and females. Condoms (Figure 3.1 a, b) are barriers made of thin rubber/ latex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or vagina and cervix in the female, just before coitus so that the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female reproductive tract. This can prevent conception.‘Nirodh' is a popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms has increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of protecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS.Both the male and the female condoms are disposable, can be self-inserted and thereby gives privacy to the user. Diaphragms,cervical caps and vaults are also barriers made of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive tract to cover the cervix during coitus.They prevent conception by blocking the entry of sperms through the cervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and foams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase their contraceptive efficiency. \n\nAnother effective and popular method is the use of Intra Uterine Devices (IUDs). These devices are inserted by doctors or expert nurses in the uterus through vagina. These Intra Uterine Devices are presently available as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing IUDs (CuT,Cu7,Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs (Progestasert, LNG-2O) (Figure 3.2). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms within the uterus and the Cu ions released suppress sperm motility and the fertilising capacity of sperms. The hormone releasing IUDs, in addition, make the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the cervix hostile to the sperms. IUDs are ideal contraceptives for the females who want to delay pregnancy and/or space children.It is one of most widely accepted methods of contraception in India. \n\nOral administration of small doses of either progestogens or progestogen-estrogen combinations is another contraceptive method used by the females. They are used in the form of tablets and hence are popularly called the pills. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days starting preferably within the first five days of menstrual cycle. After a gap of 7 days (during which menstruation occurs) it has to be repeated in the same pattern till the female desires to prevent conception. They inhibit ovulation and implantation as well as alter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/retard entry of sperms. Pills are very effective with lesser side effects and are well accepted by the females. Saheli-the new oral contraceptive for the females contains a non-steroidal preparation. It is a ‘once a week' pill with very few side effects and high contraceptive value. 一 \n\nProgestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used by females as injections or implants under the skin (Figure 3.3). Their mode of action is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are much longer. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen combinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be very effective as emergency contraceptives as they could be used to avoid possible pregnancy due to rape or casual unprotected intercourse. \n\nSurgical methods, also called sterilisation, are generally advised for the male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more \n\nThe Medical Termination   \nof Pregnancy   \n(Amendment) Act, 2017   \nwas enacted by the   \ngovernment of India with   \nthe intension of   \nreducing the incidence of   \nillegal abortion and   \nconsequent maternal   \nmortality and morbidity.   \nAccording to this Act, a   \npregnancy may be   \nterminated on certain   \nconsidered grounds   \nwithin the first 12 weeks   \nof pregnancy on the   \nopinion of one registered   \nmedical practitioner. If   \nthe pregnancy has lasted   \nmore than 12 weeks, but   \nfewer than 24 weeks, two   \nregistered medical   \npractitioners must be of   \nthe opinion, formed in   \ngood faith, that the   \nrequired ground exist.   \nThe grounds for such   \ntermination of   \npregnancies are:   \n(i) The continuation of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury physical or mental health; or   \n(ii There is a substantial risk that of the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. \n\npregnancies. Surgical intervention blocks gamete transport and thereby prevent conception. Sterilisation procedure in the male is called ‘vasectomy' and that in the female,\\`tubectomy'. In vasectomy, a small part of the vas deferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum (Figure 3.4a) whereas in tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is removed (Figure 3.4b) or tied up through a smallincision in the abdomen or through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their reversibility is very poor. \n\nIt needs to be emphasised that the selection of a suitable contraceptive method and its use should always be undertaken in consultation with qualified medical professionals. One must also remember that contraceptives are not regular requirements for the maintenance of reproductive health. In fact, they are practiced against a natural reproductive event, i.e., conception/pregnancy. One is forced to use these methods either to prevent pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy due to personal reasons. No doubt, the widespread use of these methods have a significant role in checking uncontrolled growth of population. However, their possible ill-effects like nausea,abdominal pain, breakthrough bleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding or even breast cancer, though not very significant, should not be totally ignored. \n\n3.3 MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY (MTP) \n\nIntentional or voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term is called medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) or induced abortion. Nearly 45 to 5O million MTPs are performed in a year all over the world which accounts to 1/5th of the total number of conceived pregnancies in a year. Whether to accept /legalise MTP or not is being debated upon in many countries due to emotional, ethical, religious and social issues involved in it. Government of India legalised MTP in 1971 with some strict conditions to avoid its misuse. Such restrictions are all the more important to check indiscriminate and illegal female foeticides which are reported to be high in India. \n\nWhy MTP? Obviously the answer is-to get rid of unwanted pregnancies either due to casual unprotected intercourse or failure of the contraceptive used during coitus or rapes.MTPs are also essential in certain cases where continuation of the pregnancy could be harmful or even fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or both. \n\nMTPs are considered relatively safe during the first trimester, i.e., upto 12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions are much more riskier. One disturbing trend observed is that a majority of the MTPs are performed illegally by unqualified quacks which are not only unsafe but could be fatal too.Another dangerous trend is the misuse of amniocentesis to determine the sex of the unborn child. Frequently, if the foetus is found to be female, it is followed by MTP- this is totally against what is legal. \n\nSuch practices should be avoided because these are dangerous both for the young mother and the foetus. Effective counselling on the need to avoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions as well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the mentioned unhealthy trend. \n\n3.4 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIS) \n\nInfections or diseases which are transmitted through sexual intercourse are collectively called sexually transmitted infections (STI) or venereal diseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Gonorrhoea, syphilis, genital herpes,chlamydiasis,genital warts,trichomoniasis,hepatitis-B and of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading to AIDS are some of the common STIs.Among these, HIV infection is most dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 7. \n\nSome of these infections like hepatitis-B and HIV can also be transmitted by sharing of injection needles,surgical instruments,etc., with infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to the foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections, other diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated properly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching, fluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc.,in the genital region. Infected females may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected for long. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of infection and the social stigma attached to the STIs, deter the infected persons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could lead to complications later, which include pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID),abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies,infertility or even cancer of the reproductive tract. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society. Therefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are given prime consideration under the reproductive health-care programmes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their incidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group of 15-24 years - the age group to which you also belong. There is no reason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these infections by following the simple principles given below: \n\n(i) Avoid sex with unknown partners/multiple partners. (ii) Always try to use condoms during coitus. (iii) In case of doubt, one should go to a qualified doctor for early detection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection. \n\n3.5 INFERTILITY \n\nA discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of infertility.A large number of couples all over the world including India are infertile,i.e., they are unable to produce children inspite of unprotected sexual co-habitation.The reasons for this could be many-physical, congenital,diseases，drugs,immunological or even psychological. In India,often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but more often than not, the problem lies in the male partner. Specialised health care units (infertility clinics,etc.) could help in diagnosis and corrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to have children. However, where such corrections are not possible, the couples could be assisted to have children through certain special techniques commonly known as assisted reproductive technologies (ART). \n\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF-fertilisation outside the body in almost similar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET) is one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as test tube baby programme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the husband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under simulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with upto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube (ZIFT-zygote intra fallopian transfer) and embryos with more than 8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT - intra uterine transfer), to complete its further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation (fusion of gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist those females who cannot conceive. \n\nTransfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube (GIFT- gamete intra fallopian transfer) of another female who cannot produce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and further development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo in the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum. Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate the female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be corrected by artificial insemination (AI) technique. In this technique, the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI- intra-uterine insemination) of the female. \n\nThough options are many, all these techniques require extremely high precision handling by specialised professionals and expensive instrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only in very few centres in the country. Obviously their benefits is affordable to only a limited number of people. Emotional, religious and social factors are also deterrents in the adoption of these methods. Since the ultimate aim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many orphaned and destitute children,who would probably not survive till maturity,unless taken care of. Our laws permit legal adoption and it is as yet, one of the best methods for couples looking for parenthood. \n\nSUMMARY \n\nReproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Our nation was the first nation in the world to initiate various action plans at national level towards attaining a reproductively healthy society. \n\nCounselling and creating awareness among people about reproductive organs，adolescence and associated changes, safe and hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including AIDS, etc.， is the primary step towards reproductive health. Providing medical facilities and care to the problems like menstrual irregularities, pregnancy related aspects, delivery，medical termination of pregnancy,STIs,birth control, infertility, post natal child and maternal management is another important aspect of the Reproductive and Child Health Care programmes. \n\nAn overall improvement in reproductive health has taken place in our country as indicated by reduced maternal and infant mortality rates,early detection and cure of STIs, assistance to infertile couples, etc. Improved health facilities and better living conditions promoted an explosive growth of population. Such a growth necessitated intense propagation of contraceptive methods. Various contraceptive options are available now such as natural, traditional, barrier, IUDs, pills, injectables, implants and surgical methods. Though contraceptives are not regular requirements for reproductive health, one is forced to use them to avoid pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy. \n\nMedical termination of pregnancy is legalised in our country. MTP is generally performed to get rid of unwanted pregnancy due to rapes, casual relationship, etc., as also in cases when the continuation of pregnancy could be harmful or even fatal to either the mother, or the foetus or both. \n\nInfections or diseases transmitted through sexual intercourse are called Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STIs). Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases (PIDs)， still birth, infertility are some of the complications of them.Early detection facilitate better cure of these diseases. Avoiding sexual intercourse with unknown/multiple partners,use of condoms during coitus are some of the simple precautions to avoid contracting STIs. \n\nInability to conceive or produce children even after 2 years of unprotected sexual cohabitation is called infertility. Various methods are now available to help such couples. In Vitro fertilisation followed by transfer of embryo into the female genital tract is one such method and is commonly known as the Test Tube Baby' Programme. \n\nEXERCISES \n\n1.What do you think is the significance of reproductive health in a society? \n\n2.

However the nature of those \\`factors' which determine the phenotype was not very clear. As these \\`factors' represent the genetic basis of inheritance,understanding the structure of genetic material and the structural basis of genotype and phenotype conversion became the focus of attention in biology for the next century. The entire body of molecular biology was a consequent development with major contributions from Watson, Crick, Nirenberg, Khorana, Kornbergs (father and son), Benzer,Monod, Brenner, etc. A paralel problem being tackled was the mechanism of evolution. Awareness in the areas of molecular genetics, structural biology and bio informatics have enriched our understanding of the molecular basis of evolution. In this unit the structure and function of DNA and the story and theory of evolution have been examined and explained. \n\nJames Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928. In 1947, he received B.Sc. degree in Zoology. During these years his interest in bird-watching had matured into a serious desire to learn genetics. This became possible when he received a Fellowship for graduate study in Zoology at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D. degreein1950onastudyoftheeffectofhardX-raysonbacteriophage multiplication. \n\nJAMES WATSON FRANCIS CRICK \n\nHe met Crick and discovered their common interest in solving the DNA structure.Theirfirst serious effort, was unsatisfactory. Their second effort based upon more experimental evidence and better appreciation of the nucleic acid literature,resulted, early in March 1953, in the proposal of the complementary double-helical configuration. \n\nFrancis Harry Compton Crick was born on 8 June 1916, at Northampton, England. He studied physics at University College, London and obtained a B.Sc.in 1937. He completed Ph.D.in 1954 on a thesis entitled \"X-ray Diffraction: Polypeptides and Proteins\". \n\nA critical influence in Crick's career was his friendship with J. D. Watson, then a young man of 23, leading in 1953 to the proposal of the double-helical structure for DNA and the replication scheme. Crick was made an F.R.S. in 1959. \n\nThe honours to Watson with Crick include: the John Collins Warren Prize of the Massachusetts General Hospital, in 1959; the Lasker Award, in 1960; the Research Corporation Prize, in 1962 and above al, the Nobel Prize in 1962. \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION \n\n4.1 Mendel's Laws of   \nInheritance   \n4.2 Inheritance of One Gene   \n4.3 Inheritance ofTwo Genes   \n4.4 Sex Determination   \n4.5 Mutation   \n4.6Genetic Disorders \n\nHave you ever wondered why an elephant always gives birth only to a baby elephant and not some other animal? Or why a mango seed forms only a mango plant and not any other plant? \n\n一 Given that they do, are the offspring identical to their parents? Or do they show differences in some of their characteristics? Have you ever wondered why siblings sometimes look so similar to each other? Or sometimes even so different? \n\nThese and several related questions are dealt with, scientifically,in a branch of biology known as Genetics. This subject deals with the inheritance,as well as the variation of characters from parents to offspring. Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny;it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents. \n\nHumans knew from as early as 80o0-10oo B.C. that one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual reproduction. They exploited the variations that were naturally present in the wild populations of plants and animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that possessed desirable characters.For example,through artificial selection and domestication from ancestral wild cows,we have well-known Indian breeds,e.g., Sahiwal cows in Punjab.We must, however, recognise that though our ancestors knew about the inheritance of characters and variation,they had very little idea about the scientific basis of these phenomena. \n\n4.1 MENDEL'S LAWS OF INHERITANCE \n\nIt was during the mid-nineteenth century that headway was made in the understanding of inheritance.Gregor Mendel, conducted hybridisation experiments on garden peas for seven years (1856-1863) and proposed the laws of inheritance in living organisms. During Mendel's investigations into inheritance patterns it was for the first time that statistical analysis and mathematical logic were applied to problems in biology. His experiments had a large sampling size,which gave greater credibility to the data that he collected. Also, the confirmation of his inferences from experiments on successive generations of his test plants, proved that his results pointed to general rules of inheritance rather than being unsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated characters in the garden pea plant that were manifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or dwarf plants，yellow or green seeds.This allowed him to set up a basic framework of rules governing inheritance,which was expanded on by later scientists to account for all the diverse natural observations and the complexity inherent in them. \n\nMendel conducted such artificial pollination/cross pollination experiments using several true-breeding pea lines.A truebreeding line is one that, having undergone continuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and expression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties,as pairs which were similar except for one character with contrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or wrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inflated (full) or constricted green or yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 4.1, Table 4.1). \n\n4.2 INHERITANCE OF ONE GENE \n\nLet us take the example of one such hybridisation experiment carried out by Mendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea plants to study the inheritance of one gene (Figure 4.2). He collected the seeds produced as a result of this cross and grew them to generate plants of the first hybrid generation. This generation is also called the Filial, progeny or the $\\mathbf { F _ { 1 } }$ . Mendel observed that all the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ progeny plants were tall, like one of its parents; none were dwarf (Figure 4.3). He made similar observations for the other pairs of traits - he found that the $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ } _ { 1 }$ always resembled either one of the parents,and that the trait of the other parent was not seen in them. \n\nMendel then self-pollinated the tall $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ plants and to his surprise found that in the $\\mathrm { F i l i a l } _ { 2 }$ generation some of the offspring were ‘dwarf'; the character that was not seen in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ generation was now expressed. The proportion of plants that were dwarf were \n\n$1 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ of the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plants while $3 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ of the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plants were tall. The tal and dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any blending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of inbetween height (Figure 4.3). \n\nSimilar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied: only one of the parental traits was expressed in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ generation while at the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ stage both the traits were expressed in the proportion 3:1. The contrasting traits did not show any blending at either $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ or $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ stage. \n\nBased on these observations, Mendel proposed that something was being stably passed down, unchanged, from parent to offspring through the gametes， over successive generations.He called these things as ‘factors'. Now we call them as genes. Genes, therefore, are the units of inheritance.They contain the information that is required to express a particular trait in an organism. Genes which code for a pair of contrasting traits are known as alleles,i.e.， they are slightly different forms of the same gene. \n\nIf we use alphabetical symbols for each gene, then the capital letter is used for the trait expressed at the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ stage and the small alphabet for the other trait. For example, in case of the character of height, T is used for the Tall trait and t for the‘dwarf', and T and t are alleles of each other. Hence,in plants the pair of alleles for height would be TT, Tt or tt. Mendel also proposed that ina true breeding, tall or dwarf pea variety the allelic pair of genes for height are \n\nidentical or homozygous, TT and tt, respectively. TT and tt are called the genotype of the plant while the descriptive terms tall and dwarf are the phenotype. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a genotype Tt? \n\nAs Mendel found the phenotype of the $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ } _ { 1 }$ heterozygote Tt to be exactly like the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar factors,one dominates the other (as in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ ) and hence is called the dominant factor while the other factor is recessive .In this case T (for tallness) is dominant over t (for dwarfness), that is recessive.He observed identical behaviour for all the other characters/trait-pairs that he studied. \n\nIt is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an alphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and recessiveness. (Do not use T for tall and d for dwarf because you will find it difficult to remember whether T and d are alleles of the same gene/character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes TT and tt or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote Tt. Since the Tt plant is heterozygous for genes controlling one character (height), it is a monohybrid and the cross between TT and tt is a monohybrid cross. \n\nFrom the observation that the recessive parental trait is expressed without any blending in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ generation,we can infer that, when the tall and dwarf plant produce gametes,by the process of meiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or segregate from each other and only one allele is transmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles is a random process and so there is a 5O per cent chance of a gamete containing either allele,as has been verified by the results of the crossings. In this way the gametes of the tall TT plants have the allele T and the gametes of the dwarf tt plants have the allele t. During fertilisation the two alleles, T from one parent say, through the pollen,and t from the other parent, then through the egg,are united to produce zygotes that have one $\\pmb { \\tau }$ allele and one t allele. In other words the hybrids have Tt. Since these hybrids contain alleles which express contrasting traits, the plants are heterozygous. The production of gametes by the parents, the formation of the zygotes,the $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plants can be understood from a diagram called Punnett Square as shown in Figure 4.4. It was developed by a British geneticist, Reginald C. Punnett. It is a graphical representation to calculate the probability of all possible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross. The possible gametes are written on two sides, usually the top row and left columns. All possible combinations are represented in boxes below in the squares,which generates a square output form. \n\nThe Punnett Square shows the parental tall TT (male) and dwarf tt (female) plants, the gametes produced by them and, the $\\mathrm { ~ F ~ } _ { 1 } \\mathrm { ~ \\bf ~ T t }$ progeny. The $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ plants of genotype $\\pmb { \\mathrm { T t } }$ are self-pollinated. The symbols $\\mathfrak { L }$ and $\\pmb { \\sigma }$ are used to denote the female (eggs) and male (pollen) of the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ generation, respectively. The $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ plant of the genotype Tt when self-pollinated, produces gametes of the genotype $\\mathbf { T }$ and t in equal proportion. When fertilisation takes place, the pollen grains of genotype T have a 5O per cent chance to pollinate eggs of the genotype T, as well as of genotype t. Also pollen grains of genotype t have a 50 per cent chance of pollinating eggs of genotype T,as well as of genotype t. As a result of random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can be of the genotypes TT, Tt or tt. \n\nFrom the Punnett square it is easily seen that $1 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ of the random fertilisations lead to TT,1/2 lead to Tt and $1 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ to tt. Though the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ have a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall'. At $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ $3 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are Tt. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with the genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one character $\\mathbf { \\Delta } ^ { \\bullet } \\mathbf { T }$ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall is said to dominate over the other allele t or 'dwarf' character. It is thus due to this dominance of one character over the other that all the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ are tall (though the genotype is $\\pmb { \\mathrm { T t } }$ ）and in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ $3 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ of the plants are tall (though genotypically 1/2 are Tt and only $1 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ are TT). This leads to a phenotypic ratio of 3/4th tall : ( $[ 1 / 4 \\mathbf { T } \\mathbf { T } + 1 / 2 \\mathbf { T } \\mathbf { t } ]$ and $1 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio, but a genotypic ratio of 1:2:1. \n\nThe $1 / 4 : 1 / 2 : 1 / 4$ ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable to the form of the binomial expression $( \\mathbf { a x } + \\mathbf { b y } ) ^ { 2 }$ ， that has the gametes bearing genes $\\pmb { \\tau }$ or t in equal frequency of $\\%$ . The expression is expanded as given below : \n\nMendel self-pollinated the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plants and found that dwarf $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plants continued to generate dwarf plants in $\\mathrm { F } _ { 3 }$ and $\\mathrm { F _ { 4 } }$ generations. He concluded that the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous - tt. What do you think he would have got had he self-pollinated a tall $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plant? \n\nFrom the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the genotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ or $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine the genotype of a tall plant at $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ ，Mendel crossed the tall plant from $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an organism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead of self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to predict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 4.5 shows the results of typical test cross where violet colour flower (V) is dominant over white colour flower (v). \n\nUsing Punnett square, try to find out the nature ofoffspring ofa test cross. \n\nWhat ratio did you get? \n\nUsing the genotypes of this cross, can you give a general definition for a test cross? \n\nBased on his observations on monohybrid crosses Mendel proposed two general rules to consolidate his understanding of inheritance in monohybrid crosses. Today these rules are called the Principles or Laws of Inheritance: the First Law or Law of Dominance and the Second Law or Law of Segregation. \n\n4.2.1 Law of Dominance \n\n(i) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors.   \n(ii) Factors occur in pairs.   \n(ii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates (dominant) the other (recessive). \n\nThe law of dominance is used to explain the expression of only one of the parental characters in a monohybrid cross in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ and the expression of both in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ . It also explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ \n\n4.2.2 Law of Segregation \n\nThis law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending and that both the characters are recovered as such in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ generation though one of these is not seen at the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ stage. Though the parents contain two alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles ofa pair segregate from each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors. Of course,a homozygous parent produces all gametes that are similar while a heterozygous one produces two kinds of gametes each having one allele with equal proportion. \n\n4.2.2.1 Incomplete Dominance \n\nWhen experiments on peas were repeated using other traits in other plants, it was found that sometimes the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ had a phenotype that did not resemble either of the two parents and was in between the two. The inheritance of flower colour in the dog flower (snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example to understand incomplete dominance. In a cross between true-breeding red-flowered (RR) and truebreeding white-flowered plants (rr), the $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } \\left( \\mathbf { R r } \\right)$ was pink (Figure 4.6). When the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ was self-pollinated the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ resulted in the following ratio $1 \\mathbf { ( R R ) } \\mathbf { R e d } : 2$ (Rr) Pink : 1 (rr) White. Here the genotype ratios were exactly as we would expect in any mendelian monohybrid cross,but the phenotype ratios had changed from the 3:1 dominant : recessive ratio. What happened was that $\\mathbf { R }$ was not completely dominant over r and this made it possible to distinguish Rr as pink from RR (red) and rr (white) . \n\nExplanation of the concept of dominance: \n\nWhat exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles dominant and some recessive? To tackle these questions, we must understand what a gene does. Every gene, as you know by now, contains the information to express a particular trait. In a diploid organism, there are two copies of each gene, i.e., as a pair of alleles.Now, these two alleles need not always be identical, as in a heterozygote. One of them may be different due to some changes that it has undergone (about which you will read further on, and in the next chapter) which modifies the information that particular allele contains. \n\nLet's take an example of a gene that contains the information for producing an enzyme. Now there are two copies of this gene,the two allelic forms. Let us assume (as is more common) that the normal allele produces the normal enzyme that is needed for the transformation of a substrate S. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for production of - \n\n(i) the normal/less efficient enzyme, or (ii) a non-functional enzyme, or (iii) no enzyme at all \n\nIn the first case, the modified allele is equivalent to the unmodified allele, i.e., it will produce the same phenotype/trait, i.e., result in the transformation of substrate S. Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the allele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may be effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning of the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents the original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is generally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait is seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced. \n\n4.2.2.2 Co-dominance \n\nTill now we were discussing crosses where the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ resembled either of the two parents (dominance) or was in-between (incomplete dominance). But, in the case of co-dominance the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ generation resembles both parents. A good example is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO blood grouping in human beings. ABO blood groups are controlled by the gene I. The plasma membrane of the red blood cells has sugar polymers that protrude from its surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the gene. The gene () has three alleles $\\pmb { F } ^ { \\pmb { A } }$ ， $\\pmb { I ^ { B } }$ and i. The alleles $\\pmb { F } ^ { \\pmb { A } }$ and $\\pmb { I ^ { B } }$ produce a slightly different form of the sugar while allele i does not produce any sugar. Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses any two of the three Igene alleles. $\\pmb { I } ^ { \\pmb { A } }$ and $\\pmb { I ^ { B } }$ are completely dominant over i, in other words when ${ \\pmb { I } } ^ { \\pmb { A } }$ and iare present only $\\pmb { F } ^ { \\pmb { A } }$ expresses (because i does not produce any sugar), and when $\\pmb { I } ^ { B }$ and iare present $\\pmb { I ^ { B } }$ expresses. But when $\\pmb { F } ^ { \\pmb { A } }$ and $\\pmb { I ^ { B } }$ are present together they both express their own types of sugars: this is because of co-dominance.Hence red blood cells have both A and B types of sugars. Since there are three different alleles, there are six different combinations of these three alleles that are possible,and therefore, a total of six different genotypes of the human ABO blood types (Table 4.2). How many phenotypes are possible? \n\nDo you realise that the example of ABO blood grouping also provides a good example of multiple alleles? Here you can see that there are more than two,i.e.， three alleles, governing the same character. Since in an individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found only when population studies are made. \n\nOccasionally,a single gene product may produce more than one effect. For example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It has two alleles (B and b). Starch is synthesised effectively by BB homozygotes and therefore,large starch grains are produced. In contrast, bb homozygotes have lesser efciency in starch synthesis and produce smaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, BB seeds are round and the bb seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and so B seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are of intermediate size in Bb seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as the phenotype，then from this angle,the alleles show incomplete dominance. \n\nTherefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the product that it has information for. It depends as much on the gene product and the production of a particular phenotype from this product as it does on the particular phenotype that we choose to examine, in case more than one phenotype is influenced by the same gene. \n\n4.3 INHERITANCE OF TWO GENES \n\nMendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two characters, as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with yellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour and wrinkled shape (Figure 4.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting from the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped seeds. Here can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow / green colour and round/wrinkled shape was dominant? \n\nThus，yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape dominant over wrinkled. These results were identical to those that he got when he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and green seeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants. \n\nLet us use the genotypic symbols $\\mathbf { r }$ for dominant yellow seed colour and $\\mathbf { y }$ for recessive green seed colour, $\\mathbf { R }$ for round shaped seeds and r for wrinkled seed shape. The genotype of the parents can then be written as RRYY and rryy. The cross between the two plants can be written down as in Figure 4.7 showing the genotypes of the parent plants. The gametes RY and ry unite on fertilisation to produce the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ hybrid $\\mathbf { R r Y }$ .When Mendel self hybridised the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ plants he found that $3 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ of $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plants had yellow seeds and $1 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ had green. The yellow and green colour segregated in a 3:1 ratio. Round and wrinkled seed shape also segregated in a 3:1 ratio; just like in a monohybrid cross. \n\n4.3.1 Law of Independent Assortment \n\nIn the dihybrid cross (Figure 4.7),the phenotypes round,yellow; wrinkled,yellow; round, green and wrinkled,green appeared in the ratio 9:3:3:1. Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of characters that Mendel studied. \n\nThe ratio of 9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow: 1 green,with 3 round :1 wrinkled. This derivation can be written as follows: \n\n(3 Round : 1 Wrinkled) (3 Yellow : 1 Green) $= 9$ Round, Yellow : 3 Wrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round, Green $: 1$ Wrinkled, Green \n\nBased upon such observations on dihybrid crosses (crosses between plants differing in two traits) Mendel proposed a second set of generalisations that we call Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment. The law states that 'when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters'. \n\nThe Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the independent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis and the production of eggs and pollen in the $\\mathrm { F } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } \\mathrm { \\bf R r Y } { \\bf y }$ plant. Consider the segregation of one pair of genes R and r. Fifty per cent of the gametes have the gene R and the other 5O per cent have r. Now besides each gamete having either $\\mathbf { R }$ or r, it should also have the allele $\\mathbf { r }$ or $\\mathbf { y }$ The important thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent $\\mathbf { R }$ and 50 per cent $\\mathbf { \\Delta } _ { r }$ is independent from the segregation of 5O per cent $\\mathbf { r }$ and 50 per cent y. Therefore, 50 per cent of the $\\pmb { \\mathrm { r } }$ bearing gametes has $\\mathbf { r }$ and the other 5O per cent has y. Similarly, 5O per cent of the $\\mathbf { R }$ bearing gametes has $\\mathbf { r }$ and the other 50 per cent has $\\mathbf { y }$ .Thus there are four genotypes of gametes (four types of pollen and four types of eggs). The four types are RY, Ry, rYand ry each with a frequency of 25 per cent or $1 / 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ of the total gametes produced. When you write down the four types of eggs and pollen on the two sides of a Punnett square it is very easy to derive the composition of the zygotes that give rise to the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ plants (Figure 4.7). Although there are 16 squares how many different types of genotypes and phenotypes are formed? Note them down in the format given. \n\nCan you, using the Punnett square data work out the genotypic ratio at the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ stage and fill in the format given? Is the genotypic ratio also 9:3:3:1? \n\n4.3.2 Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance \n\nMendel published his work on inheritance of characters in 1865 but for several reasons,it remained unrecognised till 19oo.Firstly, communication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work could not be widely publicised. Secondly, his concept of genes (or factors,in Mendel's words) as stable and discrete units that controlled the expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend' with each other,was not accepted by his contemporaries as an explanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature. Thirdly, Mendel's approach of using mathematics to explain biological phenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the biologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel's work suggested that factors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical proof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of. \n\nIn 19oo,three Scientists (de Vries,Correns and von Tschermak) independently rediscovered Mendel's results on the inheritance of characters.Also,by this time due to advancements in microscopy that were taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division. This led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to double and divide just before each cell division. These were called chromosomes (colored bodies, as they were visualised by staining). By 1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out. Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of chromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used chromosome movement (Figure 4.8) to explain Mendel's laws (Table 4.3). Recall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis (equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The important things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes occur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous sites on homologous chromosomes. \n\nDuring Anaphase of meiosis I, the two chromosome pairs can align at the metaphase plate independently of each other (Figure 4.9). To understand this, compare the chromosomes of four different colour in the left and right columns. In the left column (Possibility I) orange and green is segregating together. But in the right hand column (Possibility I) the orange chromosome is segregating with the red chromosomes. \n\nPossibility I   \nOne long orange and short green   \nchromosome and long yellow and   \nshort red chromosome at the same pole \n\nPossibility II One long orange and short red chromosome and long yellow and short green chromosome at the same pole \n\nSutton and Boveri argued that the pairing and separation of a pair of chromosomes would lead to the segregation of a pair of factors they carried. Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal segregation with Mendelian principles and called it the chromosomal theory of inheritance. \n\nFollowing this synthesis of ideas, experimental verification of the chromosomal theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues,led to discovering the basis for the variation that sexual reproduction produced. Morgan worked with the tiny fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 4.1O), which were found very suitable for such studies. They could be grown on simple synthetic medium in the laboratory. They complete their life cycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large number of progeny flies.Also, there was a clear differentiation of the sexes - the male and female flies are easily distinguishable.Also,it has many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low power microscopes. 人 \n\n4.3.3 Linkage and Recombination \n\nMorgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes that were sex-linked. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried out by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied, white-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ progeny. He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently of each other and the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ ratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3: 1 ratio (expected when the two genes are independent). \n\nMorgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X chromosome (Section 4.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 4.11). Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed very low recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross A) while others were loosely linked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 4.11,Cross B). For example he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked and showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white and miniature wing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and ‘mapped' their position on the chromosome. Today genetic maps are extensively used as a starting point in the sequencing of whole genomes as was done in the case of the Human Genome Sequencing Project,described later. \n\n4.4 POLYGENIC INHERITANCE \n\nMendel's studies mainly described those traits that have distinct alternate forms such as flower colour which are either purple or white. But if you look around you will find that there are many traits which are not so distinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example, in humans we don't just have tall or short people as two distinct alternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally controlled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits. Besides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes into account the influence of environment. Human skin colour is another classic example for this.In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the contribution of each allele,i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To understand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin colour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for dark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour. The genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest skin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the lightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles and three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour. In this manner the number of each type of alleles in the genotype would determine the darkness or lightness of the skin in an individual. \n\n4.5 PLEIOTROPY \n\nWe have so far seen the effect of a gene on a single phenotype or trait. There are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple phenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The underlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene on metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes. An example of this is the disease phenylketonuria,which occurs in humans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests itself through phenotypic expression characterised by mental retardation and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation. \n\n4.6 SEX DETERMINATION \n\nThe mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the geneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism of sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried out in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of insects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal basis of sex-determination. Henking (l891) could trace a specific nuclear structure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects,and it was also observed by him that 5O per cent of the sperm received this structure after spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive it. Henking gave a name to this structure as the X body but he could not explain its significance.Further investigations by other scientists led to the conclusion that the ‘X body' of Henking was in fact a chromosome and that is why it was given the name X-chromosome. It was also observed that in a large number of insects the mechanism of sex determination is of the XO type, i.e., all eggs bear an additional X-chromosome besidesthe other chromosomes (autosomes). On the other hand, some of the sperms bear the X-chromosome whereas some do not. Eggs fertilised by sperm having an X-chromosome become females and, those fertilised by sperms that do not have an X-chromosome become males.Do you think the number of chromosomes in the male and female are equal? Due to the involvement of the X-chromosome in the determination of sex, it was designated to be the sex chromosome, and the rest of the chromosomes were $\\Bumpeq$ named as autosomes.Grasshopper is an example of XO type of sex determination in which the males have only one X-chromosome besides the autosomes, whereas females have a pair of X-chromosomes. \n\nThese observations led to the investigation of a number of species to understand the mechanism of sex determination. Ina number of other insects and mammals including man, XY type of sex determination is seen where both male and female have same number of chromosomes. Among the males an X-chromosome is present but its counter part is distinctly smaller and called the Y-chromosome. Females,however,have a pair of Xchromosomes.Both males and females bear same number of autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY, while female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings and in Drosophila the males have one Xand one Y chromosome, whereas females have a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 4.12 a, b). \n\nIn the above description you have studied about two types of sex determining mechanisms,i.e., XO type and XY type.But in both cases males produce two different types of gametes, (a) either with or without X-chromosome or (b) some gametes with X-chromosome and some with Y-chromosome. Such types of sex determination mechanism is designated to be the example of male heterogamety. In some other organisms, e.g., birds,a different mechanism of sex determination is observed (Figure 4.12 c).In this case the total number of chromosome is same in both males and females.But two different types of gametes in terms of the sex chromosomes, are produced by females, i.e., female heterogamety. In order to have a distinction with the mechanism of sex determination described earlier, the two different sex chromosomes of a female bird has been designated to be the Z and W chromosomes. In these organisms the females have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of Z-chromosomes besides the autosomes. \n\n4.6.1 Sex Determination in Humans \n\nIt has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in case of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present, 22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes.A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female,whereas the presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male characteristic. During spermatogenesis among males， two types of gametes are produced. 5O per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X-chromosome and the rest 5O per cent has Y-chromosome besides the autosomes. Females,however, produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the ovum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the ovum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops into a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome carrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it is the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child. It is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 5O per cent probability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in our society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and have been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion. \n\n4.6.2 Sex Determination in Honey Bee \n\nThe sex determination in honey bee is based on the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female (queen or worker),and an unfertilised egg develops as a male (drone) by means of parthenogenesis. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes than that of a female.The females are diploid having 32 chromosomes and males are haploid,i.e.，having l6 chromosomes. This is called as haplodiploid sex-determination system and has special characteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis (Figure 4.13), they do not have father and thus cannot have sons, but have a grandfather and can have grandsons. \n\nHow is the sex-determination mechanism different in the birds? Is the sperm or the egg responsible for the sex of the chicks? \n\n4.7 MUTATION \n\nMutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences and consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype of an organism. In addition to recombination,mutation is another phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA. \n\nAs you will learn in Chapter 5, one DNA helix runs continuously from one end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form. Therefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of DNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be located on chromosomes,alteration in chromosomes results in abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells. \n\nIn addition to the above, mutation also arise due to change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known as point mutation. A classical example of such a mutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions of base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations (see Chapter 5). \n\nThe mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope of this discussion,at this level. However, there are many chemical and physical factors that induce mutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV radiations can cause mutations in organisms - it is a mutagen. \n\n4.8 GENETIC DISORDERS \n\n4.8.1 Pedigree Analysis \n\nThe idea that disorders are inherited has been prevailing in the human society since long. This was based on the heritability of certain characteristic features in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel's work the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of traits in human beings began. Since it is evident that control crosses that can be performed in pea plant or some other organisms,are not possible in case of human beings，study of the family history about inheritance of a particular trait provides an alternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family is called the pedigree analysis.In the pedigree analysis the inheritance of a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations. \n\nIn human genetics,pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is utilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease. Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis have been shown in Figure 4.13. \n\nAs you have studied in this chapter, each and every feature in any organism is controlled by one or the other gene located on the DNA present in the chromosome.DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence transmitted from one generation to the other without any change or alteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such an alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation. A number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated with the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes. \n\n4.8.2 Mendelian Disorders \n\nBroadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories -Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal disorders.Mendelian disorders are mainly determined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders are transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in the principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian disorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common and prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sicklecell anaemia, Colour blindness,Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc.It is important to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be dominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand whether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is evident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier female to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 4.14 for dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design pedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome. \n\nColour Blindness : It is a sex-linked recessive disorder due to defect in either red or green cone of eye resulting in failure to discriminate between red and green colour. This defect is due to mutation in certain genes present in the X chromosome. It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and only about O.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to red-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome.Males have only one X chromosome and females have two. The son of a woman who carries the gene has a 5O per cent chance of being colour blind. The mother is not herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. That means that its effect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene.A daughter will not normally be colour blind, unless her mother is a carrier and her father is colour blind. \n\nHaemophilia : This sex linked recessive disease，which shows its transmission from unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny has been widely studied. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of the cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to this, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding. The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease to sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely rare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the father should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family pedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents as she was a carrier of the disease. \n\nSickle-cell anaemia $:$ This is an autosome linked recessive trait that can be transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The disease is controlled by a single pair of allele, $\\mathrm { H b ^ { A } }$ and $\\mathrm { H b ^ { s } }$ . Out of the three possible genotypes only homozygous individuals for $\\mathrm { H b ^ { s } }$ $\\mathrm { ( H b ^ { s } H b ^ { s } ) }$ show the diseased phenotype. Heterozygous $\\mathrm { ( H b ^ { A } H b ^ { S } ) }$ individuals appear apparently unaffected but they are carrier of the disease as there is 5O per cent probability of transmission of the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait (Figure 4.15). The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid (Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the haemoglobin molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin protein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of the beta globin gene from GAG to GUG.The mutant haemoglobin molecule undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change in the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like structure (Figure 4.15). \n\nPhenylketonuria $:$ This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as the autosomal recessive trait. The affected individual lacks an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine.As a result of this phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid and other derivatives.Accumulation of these in brain results in mental retardation. These are also excreted through urine because of its poor absorption by kidney. \n\nThalassemia $:$ This is also an autosome-linked recessive blood disease transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are unaffected carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The defect could be due to either mutation or deletion which ultimately results in reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains (α and $\\beta$ chains) that make up haemoglobin. This causes the formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules resulting into anaemia which is characteristic of the disease. Thalassemia can be classified according to which chain of the haemoglobin molecule is affected. In α Thalassemia,production of $\\alpha$ globin chain is affected while in $\\beta$ Thalassemia, production of $\\beta$ globin chain is affected. $\\alpha$ Thalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2 on chromosome 16 of each parent and it is observed due to mutation or deletion of one or more of the four genes. The more genes affected, the less alpha globin molecules produced. While $\\beta$ Thalassemia is controlled by a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent and occurs due to mutation of one or both the genes.Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell anaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too few globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of synthesising an incorrectly functioning globin. \n\n4.8.3 Chromosomal Disorders \n\nThe chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes. \n\nFailure of segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results in the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called aneuploidy. For example, Down's syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21. Similarly, Turner's syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in human females. Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division results in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and, this phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This condition is often seen in plants. \n\nThe total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46 (23 pairs). Out of these 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of chromosomes are sex chromosome. Sometimes, though rarely, either an additional copy of a chromosome may be included in an individual or an individual may lack one of any one pair of chromosomes. These situations are known as trisomy or monosomy of a chromosome, respectively. Such a situation leads to very serious consequences in the individual. Down's syndrome, Turner's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome are common examples of chromosomal disorders. \n\nDown's Syndrome : The cause of this genetic disorder is the presence of an additional copy of the chromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21). This disorder was first described by Langdon Down (l866). The affected individual is short statured with small round head, furrowed tongue and partially open mouth (Figure 4.16). Palm is broad with characteristic palm crease. Physical, psychomotor and mental development is retarded. \n\nKlinefelter's Syndrome $:$ This genetic disorder is also caused due to the presence of an additional copy of Xchromosome resulting into a karyotype of 47, XXY. Such an individual has overall masculine development, however, the feminine development (development of breast,i.e.，Gynaecomastia) is also expressed (Figure 4.17 a). Such individuals are sterile. \n\nTurner's Syndrome : Such a disorder is caused due to the absence of one of the X chromosomes,i.e., 45 with X0, Such females are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary besides other features including lack of other secondary sexual characters (Figure 4.17 b). \n\nSUMMARY \n\nGenetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance and its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and physiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists. Mendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While studying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting characters,Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance,which are today referred to as‘Mendel's Laws of Inheritance'.He proposed that the ‘factors' (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found in pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the characters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in different-first generations $\\left( \\mathrm { F } _ { 1 } \\right)$ ，second $\\left( \\mathrm { F _ { 2 } } \\right)$ and so on. Some characters are dominant over others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are in heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters are only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never blend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not expressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it becomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of gametes (Law of Segregation). \n\nNot all characters show true dominance. Some characters show incomplete,and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the inheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors independently assort and combine in all permutations and combinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations of gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known as‘Punnett Square'. The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes regulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical expression of the chraracters is called phenotype. \n\nAfter knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a good correlation was drawn between Mendel's laws : segregation and assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel's laws were extended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance'.Later, it was found that Mendel's law of independent assortment does not hold true for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These genes were called as ‘linked genes'. Closely located genes assorted together, and distantly located genes, due to recombination,assorted independently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement of genes on a chromosome. \n\nMany genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked genes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of chromosomes which were common，and another set which was different. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were named as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as autosomes. In humans,a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in male are ZZ, and in females are ZW. \n\nMutation is defined as change in the genetic material. A point mutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is caused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of hemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a pedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of chromosomes (polyploidy) or change in a subset of chromosome number (aneuploidy). This helped in understanding the mutational basis of genetic disorders. Down's syndrome is due to trisomy of chromosome 21, where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the total number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner's syndrome, one X chromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as XO,and in Klinefelter's syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied by analysis of Karyotypes. \n\nEXERCISES \n\n1.

Over the next hundred years, the nature of the putative genetic material was investigated culminating in the realisation that DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid - is the genetic material, at least for the majority of organisms. In class XI you have learnt that nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides. \n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the two types of nucleic acids found in living systems.DNA acts as the genetic material in most of the organisms.RNA though it also acts as a genetic material in some viruses, mostly functions as a messenger. RNA has additional roles as well. It functions as adapter, structural, and in some cases as a catalytic molecule. In Class XI you have already learnt the structures of nucleotides and the way these monomer units are linked to form nucleic acid polymers. In this chapter we are going to discuss the structure of DNA, its replication, the process of making RNA from DNA (transcription), the genetic code that determines the sequences of amino acids in proteins, the process of protein synthesis (translation) and elementary basis of their regulation. The determination of complete nucleotide sequence of human genome during last decade has set in a new era of genomics. In the last section, the essentials of human genome sequencing and its consequences will also be discussed. \n\nLet us begin our discussion by first understanding the structure of the most interesting molecule in the living system, that is, the DNA. In subsequent sections, we will understand that why it is the most abundant genetic material, and what its relationship is with RNA. \n\n5.1 THE DNA \n\nDNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides. The length of DNA is usually defined as number of nucleotides (or a pair of nucleotide referred to as base pairs) present in it. This also is the characteristic of an organism. For example,a bacteriophage known as $\\Phi ^ { \\times 1 7 4 }$ has 5386 nucleotides, Bacteriophage lambda has 48502 base pairs (bp), Escherichia coli has $4 . 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ bp,and haploid content of human DNA is $3 . 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ bp. Let us discuss the structure of such a long polymer. \n\n5.1.1 Structure of Polynucleotide Chain \n\nLet us recapitulate the chemical structure of a polynucleotide chain (DNA or RNA). A nucleotide has three components - a nitrogenous base,a pentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a phosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases - Purines (Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine). Cytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in DNA. Uracil is present in RNA at the place of Thymine. A nitrogenous base is linked to the OH of $1 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { C }$ pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic linkage to form a nucleoside, such as adenosine or deoxyadenosine, guanosine or deoxyguanosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine and uridine or deoxythymidine. When a phosphate group is linked to OH of $5 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { C }$ of a nucleoside through phosphoester linkage,a corresponding nucleotide (or deoxynucleotide depending upon the type of sugar present) is formed. Two nucleotides are linked through $3 ^ { ^ { \\prime } - 5 ^ { ^ { \\prime } } }$ phosphodiester linkage to form a dinucleotide. More nucleotides can be joined in such a manner to form a polynucleotide chain.A polymer thus formed has at one end a free \n\n5' phosphate \n\nphosphate moiety at $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -end of sugar, which is referred to as $5 '$ -end of polynucleotide chain. Similarly,at the other end of the polymer the sugar has a free OH of $3 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { C }$ group which is referred to as $3 ^ { \\prime }$ -end of the polynucleotide chain. The backbone of a polynucleotide chain is formed due to sugar and phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from the backbone (Figure 5.1). \n\nIn RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional -OH group present at $2 ^ { ' }$ -position in the ribose.Also,in RNA the uracil is found at the place of thymine (5-methyl uracil, another chemical name for thymine). \n\nDNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by Friedrich Meischer in 1869.He named it as‘Nuclein'.However, due to technical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact, the elucidation of structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period of time. It was only in l953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, proposed a very simple but famous Double Helix model for the structure of DNA. One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between the two strands of polynucleotide chains. However, this proposition was also based on the observation of Erwin Chargaff that for a double stranded DNA, the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine are constant and equals one. \n\nThe base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide chains. They are said to be complementary to each other,and therefore if the sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other strand can be predicted. Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a parental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two double stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced would be identical to the parental DNA molecule. Because of this, the genetic implications of the structure of DNA became very clear. \n\nThe salient features of the Double-helix structure of DNA are as follows: \n\n(i) It is made of two polynucleotide chains,where the backbone is constituted by sugar-phosphate, and the bases project inside.   \n(ii) The two chains have anti-parallel polarity. It means, if one chain has the polarity $5 ^ { \\prime } {  } 3 ^ { \\prime }$ ,the other has $3 ^ { \\prime } {  } 5 ^ { \\prime }$ .   \n(ii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond (H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa. Similarly, Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds. As a result, always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This generates approximately uniform distance between the two strands of the helix (Figure 5.2).   \n(iv) The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch of the helix is $3 . 4 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ (a nanometre is one billionth of a metre,that is $1 0 ^ { - 9 } \\mathrm { ~ m } )$ ）and there are roughly 1O bp in each \n\nturn. Consequently, the distance between a bp in a helix is approximately $0 . 3 4 \\mathrm { n m }$ \n\n(v) The plane of one base pair stacks over the other in double helix. This, in addition to H-bonds，confers stability of the helical structure (Figure 5.3). \n\nCompare the structure of purines and pyrimidines. Can you find out why the distance between two polynucleotide chains in DNA remains almost constant? \n\nThe proposition of a double helix structure for DNA and its simplicity in explaining the genetic implication became revolutionary.Very soon，Francis Crick proposed the Central dogma in molecular biology，which states that the genetic information flows from DNA RNA→Protein. \n\nIn some viruses the flow of information is in reverse direction, that is, from RNA to DNA. Can you suggest a simple name to the process? \n\n5.1.2 Packaging of DNA Helix \n\nTaken the distance between two consecutive base pairs as $0 . 3 4 \\mathrm { n m }$ $( 0 . 3 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 9 } \\mathrm { m } )$ , if the length of DNA double helix in a typical mammalian cell is calculated (simply by multiplying the total number of bp with distance between two consecutive bp,that is, $6 . 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 } \\mathrm { b p } \\times$ $0 . 3 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 9 } \\mathrm { m / b p ) }$ , it comes out to be approximately 2.2 metres.A length that is far greater than the dimension of a typical nucleus (approximately $1 0 ^ { - 6 } \\mathrm { m } )$ How is such a long polymer packaged in a cell? \n\nIf the length of E. coli DNA is 1.36 mm, can you calculate the number of base pairs in E.coli? \n\nIn prokaryotes,such as, E. coli, though they do not have a defined nucleus, the DNA is not scattered throughout the cell. DNA (being negatively charged) is held with some proteins (that have positive charges) in a region termed as ‘nucleoid'. The DNA in nucleoid is organised in large loops held by proteins. \n\nIn eukaryotes, this organisation is much more complex. There is a set of positively charged, basic proteins called histones. A protein acquires charge depending upon the abundance of amino acids residues with charged side chains.Histones are rich in the basic amino acid residues lysine and arginine. Both the amino acid residues carry positive charges in their side chains. Histones are organised to form a unit of eight molecules called histone octamer. \n\nThe negatively charged DNA is wrapped around the positively charged histone octamer to form a structure called nucleosome (Figure 5.4 a). A typical nucleosome contains 2Oo bp of DNA helix. Nucleosomes constitute the repeating unit of a structure in nucleus called chromatin, threadlike stained (coloured) bodies seen in nucleus. The nucleosomes in chromatin are seen as beads-on-string' structure when viewed under electron microscope (EM) (Figure 5.4 b). \n\nTheoretically, how many such beads (nucleosomes) do you imagine are present in a mammalian cell? \n\nThe beads-on-string structure in chromatin is packaged to form chromatin fibers that are further coiled and condensed at metaphase stage of cell division to form chromosomes. The packaging of chromatin at higher level requires additional set of proteins that collectively are referred to as Non-histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins. In a typical nucleus, some region of chromatin are loosely packed (and stains light) and are referred to as euchromatin. The chromatin that is more densely packed and stains dark are called as Heterochromatin. Euchromatin is said to be transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is inactive. \n\n5.2 THE SEARCH FOR GENETIC MATERIAL \n\nEven though the discovery of nuclein by Meischer and the proposition for principles of inheritance by Mendel were almost at the same time, but that the DNA acts as a genetic material took long to be discovered and proven.By l926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic inheritance had reached the molecular level. Previous discoveries by Gregor Mendel, Walter Sutton, Thomas Hunt Morgan and numerous other scientists had narrowed the search to the chromosomes located in the nucleus of most cells. But the question of what molecule was actually the genetic material, had not been answered. \n\nTransforming Principle \n\nIn 1928, Frederick Grifth, in a series of experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium responsible for pneumonia)，witnessed a miraculous transformation in the bacteria. During the course of his experiment, a living organism (bacteria) had changed in physical form. \n\nWhen Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) bacteria are grown on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others produce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not. Mice infected with the S strain (virulent) die from pneumonia infection but mice infected with the R strain do not develop pneumonia. \n\nS strain →Inject into mice →Mice die R strain -→ Inject into mice →Mice live \n\nGriffith was able to kill bacteria by heating them. He observed that heat-killed S strain bacteria injected into mice did not kill them. When he \n\nS strain →Inject into mice →Mice live   \n(heat-killed) S strain   \n(heat-killed) + →Inject into mice →Mice die R strain (live) injected a mixture of heat-killed S and live R bacteria, the mice died.   \nMoreover, he recovered living S bacteria from the dead mice. \n\nHe concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been transformed by the heat-killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming principle', transferred from the heat-killed S strain,had enabled the R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent. This must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, the biochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from his experiments. \n\nBiochemical Characterisation of Transforming Principle \n\nPrior to the work of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty (1933-44), the genetic material was thought to be a protein. They worked to determine the biochemical nature of'transforming principle' in Griffith's experiment. \n\nThey purified biochemicals (proteins,DNA,RNA,etc.） from the heat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into S cells. They discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria to become transformed. 一 \n\nThey also discovered that protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and RNA-digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the transforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase did inhibit transformation，suggesting that the DNA caused the transformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material, but not all biologists were convinced. 一 \n\nCan you think of any difference between DNAs and DNase? \n\n5.2.1 The Genetic Material is DNA \n\nThe unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from the experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952). They worked with viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages. \n\nThe bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material then enters the bacterial cell. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic material as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus particles. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein or DNA from the viruses that entered the bacteria. \n\nThey grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive phosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur. Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains phosphorus but protein does not. Similarly, viruses grown on radioactive sulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because DNA does not contain sulfur. \n\nRadioactive phages were allowed to attach to E. coli bacteria. Then, as the infection proceeded, the viral coats were removed from the bacteria by agitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the bacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge. \n\nBacteria which was infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA were radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from the virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did not enter the bacteria from the viruses.DNA is therefore the genetic material that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 5.5). \n\n5.2.2 Properties of Genetic Material (DNA versus RNA) \n\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the debate between proteins versus DNA as the genetic material was unequivocally resolved from Hershey-Chase experiment. It became an established fact that it is DNA that acts as genetic material. However, it subsequently became clear that in some viruses,RNA is the genetic material (for example, Tobacco Mosaic viruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.). Answer to some of the questions such as, why DNA is the predominant genetic material, whereas RNA performs dynamic functions of messenger and adapter has to be found from the differences between chemical structures of the two nucleic acid molecules. \n\nCan you recall the two chemical differences between DNA and RNA? \n\nA molecule that can act as a genetic material must fulfill the following criteria: \n\n(i) It should be able to generate its replica (Replication).   \n(ii) It should be stable chemically and structurally.   \n(iii) It should provide the scope for slow changes (mutation) that are required for evolution.   \n(iv) It should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian Characters'. \n\nIf one examines each requirement one by one, because of rule of base pairing and complementarity, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have the ability to direct their duplications. The other molecules in the living system, such as proteins fail to fulfill first criteria itself. \n\nThe genetic material should be stable enough not to change with diferent stages of life cycle, age or with change in physiology of the organism. Stability as one of the properties of genetic material was very evident in Griffth's ‘transforming principle' itself that heat, which killed the bacteria,at least did not destroy some of the properties of genetic material. This now can easily be explained in light of the DNA that the two strands being complementary if separated by heating come together, when appropriate conditions are provided. Further, $2 ^ { \\prime }$ -OH group present at every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and easily degradable. RNA is also now known to be catalytic, hence reactive. Therefore, DNA chemically is less reactive and structurally more stable when compared to RNA. Therefore,among the two nucleic acids, the DNA is a better genetic material. \n\nIn fact, the presence of thymine at the place of uracil also confers additional stability to DNA. (Detailed discussion about this requires understanding of the process of repair in DNA, and you will study these processes in higher classes.) \n\nBoth DNA and RNA are able to mutate. In fact, RNA being unstable, mutate at a faster rate. Consequently, viruses having RNA genome and having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster. \n\nRNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins, hence can easily express the characters. DNA, however, is dependent on RNA for synthesis of proteins. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA. The above discussion indicate that both RNA and DNA can function as genetic material, but DNA being more stable is preferred for storage of genetic information. For the transmission of genetic information, RNA is better. \n\n5.3 RNA WORLD \n\nFrom foregoing discussion,an immediate question becomes evident - which is the first genetic material? It shall be discussed in detail in the chapter on chemical evolution, but briefly,we shall highlight some of the facts and points. \n\nRNA was the first genetic material. There is now enough evidence to suggest that essential life processes (such as metabolism, translation, splicing, etc.), evolved around RNA. RNA used to act as a genetic material as well as a catalyst (there are some important biochemical reactions in living systems that are catalysed by RNA catalysts and not by protein enzymes). But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and hence unstable. Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA with chemical modifications that make it more stable. DNA being double stranded and having complementary strand further resists changes by evolving a process of repair. \n\n5.4 REPLICATION \n\nWhile proposing the double helical structure for DNA, Watson and Crick had immediately proposed a scheme for replication of DNA. To quote their original statement that is as follows: \n\n“It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material\" (Watson and Crick, 1953). \n\nThe scheme suggested that the two strands would separate and act as a template for the synthesis of new complementary strands.After the completion of replication,each DNA molecule would have one parental and one newly synthesised strand. This scheme was termed as semiconservative DNA replication (Figure 5.6). \n\n5.4.1 The Experimental Proof \n\nIt is now proven that DNA replicates semiconservatively. It was shown first in Escherichia coli and subsequently in higher organisms, such as plants and human cells. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed the following experiment in 1958: \n\n(i) They grew E. coliin a medium containing $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 5 } N H _ { 4 } C l }$ $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 5 } N }$ is the heavy isotope of nitrogen) as the only nitrogen source for many generations. The result was that $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 5 } N }$ was incorporated into newly synthesised DNA (as well as other nitrogen containing compounds). This heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal DNA by centrifugation in a cesium chloride $\\scriptstyle ( \\mathbf { C s C l } )$ density gradient (Please note that $^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { N }$ is not a radioactive isotope,and it can be separated from $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 4 } N }$ only based on densities). \n\n(ii) Then they transferred the cells into a medium with normal $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 4 } N H _ { 4 } C l }$ and took samples at various definite time intervals as the cells multiplied,and extracted the DNA that remained as double-stranded helices. The various samples were separated independently on CsCl gradients to measure the densities of DNA (Figure 5.7). 1 \n\nCan you recall what centrifugal force is, and think why a molecule with higher mass/density would sediment faster? \n\n(iii) Thus,the DNA that was extracted from the culture one generation after the transfer from $^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { N }$ to $\\mathrm { ^ { 1 4 } N }$ medium [that is after 20 minutes; $E .$ coli divides in 2O minutesl had a hybrid or intermediate density. DNA extracted from the culture after another generation [that is after 4O minutes, I generation] was composed of equal amounts of this hybrid DNA and of 'light' DNA. \n\nIf E. coli was allowed to grow for 8O minutes then what would be the proportions of light and hybrid densities DNA molecule? \n\nVery similar experiments involving use of radioactive thymidine to detect distribution of newly synthesised DNA in the chromosomes was performed on Vicia faba (faba beans) by Taylor and colleagues in 1958. The experiments proved that the DNA in chromosomes also replicate semiconservatively. \n\n5.4.2 The Machinery and the Enzymes \n\nIn living cells, such as E. coli, the process of replication requires a set of catalysts (enzymes). The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the polymerisation of deoxynucleotides. These enzymes are highly efficient enzymes as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of nucleotides in a very short time. $E .$ coli that has only $4 . 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ bp (compare it with human whose diploid content is $6 . 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ bp)，completes the process of replication within 18 minutes; that means the average rate of polymerisation has to be approximately 2ooo bp per second. Not only do these polymerases have to be fast, but they also have to catalyse the reaction with high degree of accuracy. Any mistake during replication would result into mutations. Furthermore, energetically replication is a very expensive process. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes. In addition to acting as substrates, they provide energy for polymerisation reaction (the two terminal phosphates in a deoxynucleoside triphosphates are high-energy phosphates, same as in case of ATP). \n\nIn addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, many additional enzymes are required to complete the process of replication with high degree of accuracy. For long DNA molecules, since the two strands of DNA cannot be separated in its entire length (due to very high energy requirement), the replication occur within a small opening of the DNA helix， referred to as replication fork. The DNA-dependent DNA polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, that is $5 ^ { \\prime } {  } 3 ^ { \\prime }$ This creates some additional complications at the replicating fork. Consequently,on one strand (the template with polarity $3 ^ { \\prime } {  } 5 ^ { \\prime } .$ ，the replication is continuous,while on the other (the template with polarity $5 ^ { \\prime } {  } 3 ^ { \\prime } .$ ), it is discontinuous. The discontinuously synthesised fragments are later joined by the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 5.8). \n\nThe DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate the process of replication. Also the replication does not initiate randomly at any place in DNA. There is a definite region in E.coli DNA where the replication originates. Such regions are termed as origin of replication. It is because of the requirement of the origin of replication that a piece of DNA if needed to be propagated during recombinant DNA procedures, requires a vector.The vectors provide the origin of replication. \n\nFurther,not every detail of replication is understood well. In eukaryotes, the replication of DNA takes place at S-phase of the cell-cycle. The replication of DNA and cell division cycle should be highly coordinated.A failure in cell division after DNA replication results into polyploidy(a chromosomal anomaly). You will learn the detailed nature of origin and the processes occurring at this site, in higher classes. \n\n5.5 TRANSCRIPTION \n\nThe process of copying genetic information from one strand of the DNA into RNA is termed as transcription. Here also, the principle of complementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine complements now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine. However, unlike in the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an organism gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and only one of the strands is copied into RNA. This necessitates defining the boundaries that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that would be transcribed. \n\nWhy both the strands are not copied during transcription has the simple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code for RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity does not mean identical),and in turn, if they code for proteins, the sequence of amino acids in the proteins would be different. Hence, one segment of the DNA would be coding for two different proteins,and this would complicate the genetic information transfer machinery. Second, the two RNA molecules if produced simultaneously would be complementary to each other, hence would form a double stranded RNA. This would prevent RNA from being translated into protein and the exercise of transcription would become a futile one. \n\n5.5.1 Transcription Unit \n\nA transcription unit in DNA is defined primarily by the three regions in the DNA: \n\n(i) A Promoter (ii) The Structural gene (iii) A Terminator \n\nThere is a convention in defining the two strands of the DNA in the structural gene of a transcription unit. Since the two strands have opposite polarity and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase also catalyse the polymerisation in only one direction, that is, $5 ^ { \\prime } { \\xrightarrow { } } 8 ^ { \\prime }$ ,the strand that has the polarity $3 ^ { \\prime } - 5 ^ { \\prime }$ acts as a template,and is also referred to as template strand. The other strand which has the polarity $( 5 ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { - } 8 ^ { \\prime } )$ and the sequence same as RNA (except thymine at the place of uracil), is displaced during transcription. Strangely, this strand (which does not code for anything) is referred to as coding strand. All the reference point while defining a transcription unit is made with coding strand. To explain the point, a hypothetical sequence from a transcription unit is represented below: \n\n$3 ^ { ' }$ -ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC-5’Template Strand 5'-TACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG-3' Coding Strand Can you now write the sequence of RNA transcribed from the above DNA? \n\nThe promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a transcription unit. The promoter is said to be located towards $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -end (upstream) of the structural gene (the reference is made with respect to the polarity of coding strand). It is a DNA sequence that provides binding site for RNA polymerase,and it is the presence of a promoter in a transcription unit that also defines the template and coding strands. By switching its position with terminator, the definition of coding and template strands could be reversed. The terminator is located towards $3 ^ { ' }$ -end (downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the process of transcription (Figure 5.9). There are additional regulatory sequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the promoter. Some of the properties of these sequences shall be discussed while dealing with regulation of gene expression. \n\n5.5.2 Transcription Unit and the Gene \n\nA gene is defined as the functional unit of inheritance. Though there is no ambiguity that the genes are located on the DNA, it is difficult to literally define a gene in terms of DNA sequence. The DNA sequence coding for tRNA or rRNA molecule also define a gene. However by defining a cistron as a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a transcription unit could be said as monocistronic (mostly in eukaryotes) or polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the monocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences - the genes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed sequences are defined as exons. Exons are said to be those sequence that appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by introns. Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or processed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the definition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment. \n\nInheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory sequences of a structural gene. Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences are loosely defined as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do not code for any RNA or protein. \n\n5.5.3 Types of RNA and the process of Transcription \n\nIn bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA),and rRNA (ribosomal RNA). All three RNAs are needed to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template, tRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play structural and catalytic role during translation. There is single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types of RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates transcription (Initiation). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of complementarity. It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and continues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the enzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in termination of transcription. \n\nAn intriguing question is that how is the RNA polymerases able to catalyse all the three steps,which are initiation,elongation and termination. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the process of elongation. It associates transiently with initiation-factor (o) and termination-factor (p) to initiate and terminate the transcription, respectively.Association with these factors alter the specificity of the RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 5.10). \n\nIn bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become active, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria), many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria. 一 \n\nIn eukaryotes, there are two additional complexities - (i) There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus (in addition to the RNA polymerase found in the organelles). There is a clear cut division of labour. The RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNAs (28S,18S,and 5.8S),whereas the RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcription of tRNA, 5srRNA, and snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs). The RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). \n\n(ii) The second complexity is that the primary transcripts contain both the exons and the introns and are non-functional.Hence,it is subjected to a process called splicing where the introns are removed and exons are joined in a defined order. hnRNA undergoes additional processing called as capping and tailing. In capping an unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to the $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -end of hnRNA. In tailing, adenylate residues (2oO-30O) are added at $3 ^ { \\prime }$ -end in a template independent manner. It is the fully processed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the nucleus for translation (Figure 5.11). \n\nThe significance of such complexities is now beginning to be understood. The split-gene arrangements represent probably an ancient feature of the genome. The presence of introns is reminiscent of antiquity, and the process of splicing represents the dominance of RNA-world. In recent times, the understanding of RNA and RNA-dependent processes in the living system have assumed more importance. ■ \n\n5.6 GENETIC CODE \n\nDuring replication and transcription a nucleic acid was copied to form another nucleic acid. Hence, these processes are easy to conceptualise on the basis of complementarity. The process of translation requires transfer of genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides to synthesise a polymer of amino acids. Neither does any complementarity exist between nucleotides and amino acids, nor could any be drawn theoretically. There existed ample evidences, though, to support the notion that change in nucleic acids (genetic material) were responsible for change in amino acids in proteins. This led to the proposition of a genetic code that could direct the sequence of amino acids during synthesis of proteins. \n\nIf determining the biochemical nature of genetic material and the structure of DNA was very exciting, the proposition and deciphering of genetic code were most challenging. In a very true sense, it required involvement of scientists from several disciplines - physicists,organic chemists, biochemists and geneticists. It was George Gamow, a physicist, who argued that since there are only 4 bases and if they have to code for 20 amino acids, the code should constitute a combination of bases.He suggested that in order to code for all the 2O amino acids, the code should be made up of three nucleotides.This was a very bold proposition, because a permutation combination of $4 ^ { 3 }$ $( 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 )$ would generate 64 codons; generating many more codons than required. \n\nProviding proof that the codon was a triplet, was a more daunting task. The chemical method developed by Har Gobind Khorana was instrumental in synthesising RNA molecules with defined combinations of bases (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg's cell-free system for protein synthesis finally helped the code to be deciphered. Severo Ochoa enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was also helpful in polymerising RNA with defined sequences in a template independent manner (enzymatic synthesis of RNA). Finally a checker-board for genetic code was prepared which is given in Table 5.1. \n\nFirst Third position Position Second position 人 ?

(ii) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon,hence the code is degenerate. (iii) The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are no punctuations. (iv) The code is nearly universal: for example, from bacteria to human UUU would code for Phenylalanine (phe). Some exceptions to this rule have been found in mitochondrial codons,and in some protozoans. (v) AUG has dual functions.It codes for Methionine (met) ,and it also act as initiator codon. (vi) UAA, UAG, UGA are stop terminator codons. \n\nIf following is the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA, predict the sequence of amino acid coded by it (take help of the checkerboard): \n\nNow try the opposite. Following is the sequence of amino acids coded by an mRNA. Predict the nucleotide sequence in the RNA: \n\nMet-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe \n\nDo you face any difficulty in predicting the opposite? \n\nCan you now correlate which two properties of genetic code you have learnt? \n\n5.6.1 Mutations and Genetic Code \n\nThe relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation studies. You have studied about mutation and its effect in Chapter 4. Effects of large deletions and rearrangements in a segment of DNA are easy to comprehend. It may result in loss or gain of a gene and so a function. The effect of point mutations will be explained here.A classical example of point mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin chain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine. It results into a diseased condition called as sickle cell anemia. Effect of point mutations that inserts or deletes a base in structural gene can be better understood by following simple example. \n\nConsider a statement that is made up of the following words each having three letters like genetic code. \n\nRAM HAS RED CAP \n\nIf we insert a letter B in between HAS and RED and rearrange the statement, it would read as follows: \n\nRAM HAS BRE DCA(P \n\nSimilarly, if we now insert two letters at the same place, say BI'. Now it would read, \n\nRAM HAS BIR EDC AP \n\nNow we insert three letters together, say BIG, the statement would read \n\nRAM HAS BIG RED CAP \n\nThe same exercise can be repeated, by deleting the letters R, E and D, one by one and rearranging the statement to make a triplet word. \n\nRAM HAS EDC AP \n\nRAM HAS DCA P \n\nRAM HAS CAP \n\nThe conclusion from the above exercise is very obvious.Insertion or deletion of one or two bases changes the reading frame from the point of insertion or deletion.However, such mutations are referred to as frameshift insertion or deletion mutations. Insertion or deletion of three or its multiple bases insert or delete in one or multiple codon hence one or multiple amino acids,and reading frame remains unaltered from that point onwards. \n\n5.6.2 tRNA- the Adapter Molecule \n\nFrom the very beginning of the proposition of code, it was clear to Francis Crick that there has to be a mechanism to read the code and also to link it to the amino acids, because amino acids have no structural specialities to read the code uniquely. He postulated the presence of an adapter molecule that would on one hand read the code and on other hand would bind to specific amino acids. The tRNA, then called sRNA (soluble RNA), was known before the genetic code was postulated. However, its role as an adapter molecule was assigned much later. \n\ntRNA has an anticodon loop that has bases complementary to the code,and it also has an amino acid acceptor end to which it binds to amino acids. tRNAs are specific for each amino acid (Figure 5.12). For initiation,there is \n\nanother specific tRNA that is referred to as initiator tRNA. There are no tRNAs for stop codons. In figure 5.12, the secondary structure of tRNA has been depicted that looks like a clover-leaf. In actual structure, the tRNA is a compact molecule which looks like inverted L. \n\n5.7 TRANSLATION \n\nTranslation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to form a polypeptide (Figure 5.13). The order and sequence of amino acids are defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. The amino acids are joined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond. Formation of a peptide bond requires energy. Therefore, in the first phase itself amino acids are activated in the presence of ATP and linked to their cognate tRNA-a process commonly called as charging of tRNA or aminoacylation of tRNA to be more specific. If two such charged tRNAs are brought close enough, the formation of peptide bond between them would be favoured energetically. The presence of a catalyst would enhance the rate of peptide bond formation. \n\nThe cellular factory responsible for synthesising proteins is the ribosome. The ribosome consists of structural RNAs and about 80 different proteins. In its inactive state,it exists as two subunits; a large subunit and a small subunit.When the small subunit encounters an mRNA, the process of translation of the mRNA to protein begins. There are two sites in the large subunit, for subsequent amino acids to bind to and thus,be close enough to each other for the formation of a peptide bond. The ribosome also acts as a catalyst (23S rRNA in bacteria is the enzyme- ribozyme) for the formation of peptide bond. ■ \n\nA translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA that is flanked by the start codon (AUG) and the stop codon and codes for a polypeptide. An mRNA also has some additional sequences that are not translated and are referred as untranslated regions (UTR). The UTRs are present at both $5 ^ { \\prime }$ -end (before start codon) and at $3 ^ { ' }$ end (after stop codon). They are required for efficient translation process. \n\nFor initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) that is recognised only by the initiator tRNA. The ribosome proceeds to the elongation phase of protein synthesis.During this stage,complexes composed of an amino acid linked to tRNA，sequentially bind to the appropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with the tRNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into Polypeptide sequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA. At the end, a release factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the complete polypeptide from the ribosome. \n\n5.8 REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION \n\nRegulation of gene expression refers to a very broad term that may occur at various levels. Considering that gene expression results in the formation of a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels. In eukaryotes, the regulation could be exerted at \n\n(i) transcriptional level (formation of primary transcript), (ii) processing level (regulation of splicing), (ii) transport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm, (iv) translational level. \n\nThe genes in a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a set of functions. For example, if an enzyme called beta-galactosidase is synthesised by E. coli, it is used to catalyse the hydrolysis of a disaccharide,lactose into galactose and glucose; the bacteria use them as a source of energy. Hence, if the bacteria do not have lactose around them to be utilised for energy source, they would no longer require the synthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Therefore,in simple terms, it is the metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions that regulate the expression of genes. The development and differentiation of embryo into adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of expression of several sets of genes. \n\nIn prokaryotes,control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the predominant site for control of gene expression. In a transcription unit, the activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is in turn regulated by interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise start sites. These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators) and negatively (repressors) The accessibility of promoter regions of prokaryotic DNA is in many cases regulated by the interaction of proteins with sequences termed operators. The operator region is adjacent to the promoter elements in most operons and in most cases the sequences of the operator bind a repressor protein. Each operon has its specific operator and specific repressor. For example, lac operator is present only in the lac operon and it interacts specifically with lac repressor only. \n\n5.8.1 The Lac operon \n\nThe elucidation of the lac operon was also a result of a close association between a geneticist, Francois Jacob and a biochemist, Jacque Monod. They were the first to elucidate a transcriptionally regulated system. In lac operon (here lac refers to lactose), a polycistronic structural gene is regulated by a common promoter and regulatory genes. Such arrangement is very common in bacteria and is referred to as operon. To name few such examples, lac operon, trp operon, ara operon, his operon, val operon, etc. \n\nThe lac operon consists of one regulatory gene (the i gene - here the term i does not refer to inducer, rather it is derived from the word inhibitor) and three structural genes ( $[ z , y$ ,and $a$ ). The igene codes for the repressor of the lac operon. The $z$ gene codes for beta-galactosidase $\\boldsymbol { \\beta }$ gal),which is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of the disaccharide, lactose into its monomeric units,galactose and glucose.The $y$ gene codes for permease,which increases permeability of the cell to $\\beta \\mathrm { \\cdot }$ galactosides.The $a$ gene encodes a transacetylase. Hence,all the three gene products in lac operon are required for metabolism of lactose. In most other operons as well, the genes present in the operon are needed together to function in the same or related metabolic pathway (Figure 5.14). \n\nLactose is the substrate for the enzyme beta-galactosidase and it regulates switching on and off of the operon. Hence, it is termed as inducer. In the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if lactose is provided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is transported into the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a very low level of expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all the time, otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces the operon in the following manner. \n\nThe repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time - constitutively) from the i gene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In the presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is inactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase access to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 5.14). Essentially, regulation of lac operon can also be visualised as regulation of enzyme synthesis by its substrate. \n\nRemember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac operon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed in the presence of lactose? \n\nRegulation of lac operon by repressor is referred to as negative regulation. Lac operon is under control of positive regulation as well, but it is beyond the scope of discussion at this level. \n\n5.9 HUMAN GENOME PROJECT \n\nIn the preceding sections you have learnt that it is the sequence ofbases in DNA that determines the genetic information of a given organism. In other words, genetic make-up of an organism or an individual lies in the DNA sequences. If two individuals differ, then their DNA sequences should also be different,at least at some places. These assumptions led to the quest of finding out the complete DNA sequence of human genome.With the establishment of genetic engineering techniques where it was possible to isolate and clone any piece of DNA and availability of simple and fast techniques for determining DNA sequences,a very ambitious project of sequencing human genome was launched in the year 1990. \n\nHuman Genome Project (HGP) was called a mega project. You can imagine the magnitude and the requirements for the project if we simply define the aims of the project as follows: \n\nHuman genome is said to have approximately $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ bp,and if the cost of sequencing required is US $\\$ 3$ per bp (the estimated cost in the beginning), the total estimated cost of the project would be approximately 9 billion US dollars. Further, if the obtained sequences were to be stored in typed form in books,and if each page of the book contained 1000 letters and each book contained 1ooo pages, then 33oO such books would be required to store the information of DNA sequence from a single human cell. The enormous amount of data expected to be generated also necessitated the use of high speed computational devices for data storage and retrieval, and analysis. HGP was closely associated with the rapid development of a new area in biology called Bioinformatics. \n\nGoals of HGP \n\nSome of the important goals of HGP were as follows: \n\n(i) Identify all the approximately 20,0o0-25,000 genes in human DNA; (ii) Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA;   \n(iii) Store this information in databases;   \n(iv) Improve tools for data analysis; (v) Transfer related technologies to other sectors,such as industries;   \n(vi) Address the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) that may arise from the project. \n\nThe Human Genome Project was a l3-year project coordinated by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. During the early years of the HGP, the Wellcome Trust (U.K.) became a major partner; additional contributions came from Japan, France, Germany, China and others. The project was completed in 2oo3. Knowledge about the effects of DNA variations among individuals can lead to revolutionary new ways to diagnose, treat and someday prevent the thousands of disorders that affect human beings.Besides providing clues to understanding human biology, learning about non-human organisms DNA sequences can lead to an understanding of their natural capabilities that can be applied toward solving challenges in health care, agriculture, energy production, environmental remediation.Many non-human model organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans (a free living non-pathogenic nematode),Drosophila (the fruit fly),plants (rice and Arabidopsis), etc., have also been sequenced. \n\nMethodologies : The methods involved two major approaches. One approach focused on identifying all the genes that are expressed as RNA (referred to as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The other took the blind approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that contained all the coding and non-coding sequence, and later assigning different regions in the sequence with functions (a term referred to as Sequence Annotation). For sequencing, the total DNA from a cell is isolated and converted into random fragments of relatively smaller sizes (recall DNA is a very long polymer, and there are technical limitations in sequencing very long pieces of DNA) and cloned in suitable host using specialised vectors. The cloning resulted into amplification of each piece of DNA fragment so that it subsequently could be sequenced with ease. The commonly used hosts were bacteria and yeast, and the vectors were called as BAC (bacterial artificial chromosomes), and YAC (yeast artificial chromosomes). \n\nThe fragments were sequenced using automated DNA sequencers that worked on the principle of a method developed by Frederick Sanger. (Remember, Sanger is also credited for developing method for \n\ndetermination of amino acid sequences in proteins). These sequences were then arranged based on some overlapping regions present in them. This required generation of overlapping fragments for sequencing. Alignment of these sequences was humanly not possible. Therefore，specialised computer based programs were developed (Figure 5.15). These sequences were subsequently annotated and were assigned to each chromosome.The sequence of chromosome 1 was completed only in May 20o6 (this was the last of the 24 human chromosomes - 22 autosomes and X and Y - to be \n\nsequenced). Another challenging task was assigning the genetic and physical maps on the genome. This was generated using information on polymorphism of restriction endonuclease recognition sites,and some repetitive DNA sequences known as microsatellites (one of the applications of polymorphism in repetitive DNA sequences shall be explained in next section of DNA fingerprinting). \n\n5.9.1 Salient Features of Human Genome \n\nSome of the salient observations drawn from human genome project are as follows: \n\n(i) The human genome contains 3164.7 million bp.   \n(ii) The average gene consists of 3ooo bases, but sizes vary greatly, with the largest known human gene being dystrophin at 2.4 million bases.   \n(ii) The total number of genes is estimated at 30,Ooo-much lower than previous estimates of 80,0o0 to 1,40.oo0 genes. Almost all (99.9 per cent) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all humans.   \n(iv) The functions are unknown for over 5O per cent of the discovered genes.   \n(v) Less than 2 per cent of the genome codes for proteins.   \n(vi) Repeated sequences make up very large portion of the human genome.   \n(vii) Repetitive sequences are stretches of DNA sequences that are repeated many times, sometimes hundred to thousand times. They are thought to have no direct coding functions, but they shed light on chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution.   \n(viii) Chromosome 1 has most genes (2968),and the Yhas the fewest (231).   \n(ix) Scientists have identified about 1.4 milion locations where singlebase DNA differences (SNPs - single nucleotide polymorphism, pronounced as ‘snips') occur in humans. This information promises to revolutionise the processes of finding chromosomal locations for disease-associated sequences and tracing human history. \n\n5.9.2 Applications and Future Challenges \n\nDeriving meaningful knowledge from the DNA sequences will define research through the coming decades leading to our understanding of biological systems. This enormous task will require the expertise and creativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied disciplines in both the public and private sectors worldwide. One of the greatest impacts of having the HG sequence may well be enabling a radically new approach to biological research. In the past, researchers studied one or a few genes at a time.With whole-genome sequences and new high-throughput technologies,we can approach questions systematically and on a much broader scale. They can study all the genes in a genome, for example, all the transcripts in a particular tissue or organ or tumor, or how tens of thousands of genes and proteins work together in interconnected networks to orchestrate the chemistry of life. \n\n5.10 DNA FINGERPRINTING \n\nAs stated in the preceding section, 99.9 per cent of base sequence among humans is the same. Assuming human genome as $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ bp, in how many base sequences would there be differences? It is these differences in sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their phenotypic appearance. If one aims to find out genetic differences between two individuals or among individuals of a population, sequencing the DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive task. Imagine trying to compare two sets of $3 \\times { 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ base pairs. DNA fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any two individuals. \n\nDNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific regions in DNA sequence called as repetitive DNA, because in these sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These repetitive DNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during density gradient centrifugation. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and the other small peaks are referred to as satellite DNA. Depending on base composition (A : T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number of repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories, such as micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc. These sequences normally do not code for any proteins, but they form a large portion of human genome. These sequence show high degree of polymorphism and form the basis of DNA fingerprinting. Since DNA from every tissue (such as blood, hair-follicle,skin, bone,saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual show the same degree of polymorphism，they become very useful identification tool in forensic applications. Further, as the polymorphisms are inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis of paternity testing, in case of disputes. \n\nAs polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping of human genome as well as of DNA fingerprinting, it is essential that we understand what DNA polymorphism means in simple terms. Polymorphism (variation at genetic level) arises due to mutations. (Recall different kind of mutations and their effects that you have already studied in Chapter 4,and in the preceding sections in this chapter.) New mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in the germ cells (cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing organisms). If a germ cell mutation does not seriously impair individual's ability to have offspring who can transmit the mutation, it can spread to the other members of population (through sexual reproduction). Allelic (again recall the definition of alleles from Chapter 4) sequence variation has traditionally been described as a DNA polymorphism if more than one variant (allele) at a locus occurs in human population with a frequency greater than O.O1. In simple terms, if an inheritable mutation is observed in a population at high frequency,it is referred to as DNA polymorphism. The probability of such variation to be observed in noncoding DNA sequence would be higher as mutations in these sequences may not have any immediate effect/impact in an individual's reproductive ability. These mutations keep on accumulating generation after generation, and form one of the basis of variability/polymorphism. There is a variety of different types of polymorphisms ranging from single nucleotide change to very large scale changes. For evolution and speciation, such polymorphisms play very important role,and you will study these in details at higher classes. \n\nThe technique of DNA Fingerprinting was initially developed by Alec Jeffreys. He used a satellite DNA as probe that shows very high degree of polymorphism. It was called as Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR). The technique,as used earlier, involved Southern blot hybridisation using radiolabelled VNTR as a probe. It included \n\n(i) isolation of DNA,   \n(ii) digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases,   \n(ii) separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis,   \n(iv) transferring (blotting) of separated DNA fragments to synthetic membranes, such as nitrocellulose or nylon,   \n(v) hybridisation using labelled VNTR probe, and   \n(vi) detection ofhybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography.A schematic representation of DNA fingerprinting is shown in Figure 5.16. \n\nThe VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite. A small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The copy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual. The numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a result the size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { { k b } }$ . Consequently, after hybridisation with VNTR probe, the autoradiogram gives many bands of differing sizes. These bands give a characteristic pattern for an individual DNA (Figure 5.16). It differs from individual to individual in a population except in the case of monozygotic (identical) twins.The sensitivity of the technique has been increased by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCRyou will study about it in Chapter 9). Consequently, DNA from a single cell is enough to perform DNA fingerprinting analysis. In addition to application in forensic science,it has much wider application, such as in determining population and genetic diversities. Currently, many different probes are used to generate DNA fingerprints. \n\nSUMMARY \n\nNucleic acids are long polymers of nucleotides. While DNA stores genetic information, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information. Though DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being chemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material. However, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA. The hallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen bonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that Adenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds,and Guanine with Cytosine through three H-bonds. This makes one strand complementary to the other. The DNA replicates semiconservatively, the process is guided by the complementary H-bonding. A segment of DNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as gene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a template to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA. In bacteria, the transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated. In eukaryotes, the gene is split. The coding sequences,exons,are interrupted by non-coding sequences, introns. Introns are removed and exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The messenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a combination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino acid. The genetic code is read again on the principle of complementarity by tRNA that acts as an adapter molecule. There are specific tRNAs for every amino acid. The tRNA binds to specific amino acid at one end and pairs through H-bonding with codes on mRNA through its anticodons. The site of translation (protein synthesis) is ribosomes, which bind to mRNA and provide platform for joining of amino acids. One of the rRNA acts as a catalyst for peptide bond formation, which is an example of RNA enzyme (ribozyme). Translation is a process that has evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since, transcription and translation are energetically very expensive processes, these have to be tightly regulated. Regulation of transcription is the primary step for regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, more than one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as operons. Lac operon is the prototype operon in bacteria，which codes for genes responsible for metabolism of lactose. The operon is regulated by the amount of lactose in the medium where the bacteria are grown. Therefore, this regulation can also be viewed as regulation of enzyme synthesis by its substrate. \n\nHuman genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence every base in human genome. This project has yielded much new information. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a consequence of the project. DNA Fingerprinting is a technique to find out variations in individuals of a population at DNA level. It works on the principle of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It has immense applications in the field of forensic science, genetic biodiversity and evolutionary biology. \n\nEXERCISES \n\n1Group the following as nitrogenous bases and nucleosides: Adenine,Cytidine,Thymine,Guanosine,Uracil and Cytosine.   \n2.
